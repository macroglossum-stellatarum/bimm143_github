## R Functions

In this session we will work through the process of developing our own
function for calculating average grades for fictional students in a
fictional class.

We will start with a simplified version of the problem. Grade some
vectors of student scores. We want to drop the lowest score and get the
average.

``` r
# Example input vectors to start with
student1 <- c(100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 90)
student2 <- c(100, NA, 90, 90, 90, 90, 97, 80)
student3 <- c(90, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)
```

We can use the `mean()` function to get the average:

``` r
mean(student1)
```

    [1] 98.75

We can find the smallest value with the `min()` function.

``` r
min(student1)
```

    [1] 90

There is also the `which.min()` function. Let’s see if this can help:

``` r
student1
```

    [1] 100 100 100 100 100 100 100  90

``` r
which.min(student1)
```

    [1] 8

``` r
student1[which.min(student1)]
```

    [1] 90

``` r
x <- 1:5
x
```

    [1] 1 2 3 4 5

``` r
x[-4]
```

    [1] 1 2 3 5

Let’s put this together to drop the lowest value and find the average.

``` r
mean(student1[-which.min(student1)])
```

    [1] 100

Now what about student2?

``` r
student2
```

    [1] 100  NA  90  90  90  90  97  80

``` r
mean(student2[-which.min(student2)], na.rm=TRUE)
```

    [1] 92.83333

Hmmm….ok what about student 3?

``` r
student3
```

    [1] 90 NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

``` r
mean(student3[-which.min(student3)], na.rm=TRUE)
```

    [1] NaN

``` r
mean(student3, na.rm=TRUE)
```

    [1] 90

So this sucks! This inflates grades as it drops all the NAs before
determining the mean…

It seems like the function `is.na()` might be useful.

``` r
student3
```

    [1] 90 NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

``` r
is.na(student3)
```

    [1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE

``` r
student2
```

    [1] 100  NA  90  90  90  90  97  80

``` r
is.na(student2)
```

    [1] FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE

I can use a logical vector to index another vector.

``` r
student2[is.na(student2)] <- 0
student2
```

    [1] 100   0  90  90  90  90  97  80

``` r
x <- student3
x[is.na(x)] <- 0
x
```

    [1] 90  0  0  0  0  0  0  0

``` r
x <- student2
x[is.na(x)] <- 0
mean(x[-which.min(x)])
```

    [1] 91

We have our working snippet of code! This is now going to be the body of
our function.

All functions in R have at least 3 things: - A name (we pick that) -
input arguments - a body (the code that does the work) \#Q1: Working R
function to calculate the average and drop the lowest score:

``` r
grade <- function(x){
  # Mask NA to zero
  x[is.na(x)] <- 0
  # Drop lowest value and get mean
  mean(x[-which.min(x)])
}
```

Make sure to press play to send it to the R “brain”. Let’s try it out
with student 1.

``` r
grade(student1)
```

    [1] 100

``` r
grade(student2)
```

    [1] 91

``` r
grade(student3)
```

    [1] 12.85714

``` r
gradebook <- read.csv("https://tinyurl.com/gradeinput",row.names=1)
head(gradebook)
```

              hw1 hw2 hw3 hw4 hw5
    student-1 100  73 100  88  79
    student-2  85  64  78  89  78
    student-3  83  69  77 100  77
    student-4  88  NA  73 100  76
    student-5  88 100  75  86  79
    student-6  89  78 100  89  77

I can use the complicated but useful function `apply()` to use our
existing `grade()` function on the whole class gradebook.

How does the `apply()` function work?

``` r
results <- apply(gradebook,1,grade)
results
```

     student-1  student-2  student-3  student-4  student-5  student-6  student-7 
         91.75      82.50      84.25      84.25      88.25      89.00      94.00 
     student-8  student-9 student-10 student-11 student-12 student-13 student-14 
         93.75      87.75      79.00      86.00      91.75      92.25      87.75 
    student-15 student-16 student-17 student-18 student-19 student-20 
         78.75      89.50      88.00      94.50      82.75      82.75

``` r
which.max(results)
```

    student-18 
            18

``` r
which.min(apply(gradebook,2,sum,na.rm=TRUE))
```

    hw2 
      2 

Homework 2 had the lowest scores overall.

``` r
# not a good way
which.min(apply(gradebook,2,mean,na.rm=TRUE))
```

    hw3 
      3 

If I want to use the mean approach, I will need to mask the NA (missing
homeworks) to zero first.

``` r
mask <- gradebook
mask[is.na(mask)] <- 0
mask
```

               hw1 hw2 hw3 hw4 hw5
    student-1  100  73 100  88  79
    student-2   85  64  78  89  78
    student-3   83  69  77 100  77
    student-4   88   0  73 100  76
    student-5   88 100  75  86  79
    student-6   89  78 100  89  77
    student-7   89 100  74  87 100
    student-8   89 100  76  86 100
    student-9   86 100  77  88  77
    student-10  89  72  79   0  76
    student-11  82  66  78  84 100
    student-12 100  70  75  92 100
    student-13  89 100  76 100  80
    student-14  85 100  77  89  76
    student-15  85  65  76  89   0
    student-16  92 100  74  89  77
    student-17  88  63 100  86  78

    student-19  91  68  75  86  79
    student-20  91  68  76  88  76

Here we are going to look at the correlation of each Homework results
(i.e the columns in the gradebook) with the overall grade of students
from the course (in the `results` object obtained from using our
`grade()` function).

``` r
results
```

     student-1  student-2  student-3  student-4  student-5  student-6  student-7 
         91.75      82.50      84.25      84.25      88.25      89.00      94.00 
     student-8  student-9 student-10 student-11 student-12 student-13 student-14 
         93.75      87.75      79.00      86.00      91.75      92.25      87.75 
    student-15 student-16 student-17 student-18 student-19 student-20 
         78.75      89.50      88.00      94.50      82.75      82.75 

``` r
mask$hw4
```

     [1]  88  89 100 100  86  89  87  86  88   0  84  92 100  89  89  89  86  87  86
    [20]  88

I am going to use the `cor()` function:

``` r
cor(results,mask$hw4)
```

    [1] 0.3810884

``` r
cor(results,mask$hw5)
```

    [1] 0.6325982

I can use the `apply()` function to find the correlation for all
homework assignments at once.

``` r
apply(mask,2,cor, y=results)
```

          hw1       hw2       hw3       hw4       hw5 
    0.4250204 0.1767780 0.3042561 0.3810884 0.6325982 

Homework 5 was most predictive of overall score (i.e highest
correlation).
