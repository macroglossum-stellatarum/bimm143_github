Class 7: Machine Learning 1
================
Kira

In this class we will explore clustering and dimensionality reduction
methods.

## K-means

Make up some input data where we know what the answer should be.

``` r
tmp <- c(rnorm(30, -3),rnorm(30,+3))
x <- cbind(x=tmp,y=rev(tmp))
head(x)
```

                 x        y
    [1,] -4.480421 1.915289
    [2,] -3.432842 1.408299
    [3,] -2.944082 3.640351
    [4,] -2.710120 3.655904
    [5,] -1.840367 2.872581
    [6,] -3.719225 3.013332

Quick plot of x to see the two groups at -3,+3 and +3,-3.

``` r
plot(x)
```

Use the `kmeans()` function, setting k to 2 and nstart=20.

``` r
km <- kmeans(x,centers=2,nstart=20)
km
```

    K-means clustering with 2 clusters of sizes 30, 30

    Cluster means:
              x         y
    1 -2.852692  3.057076
    2  3.057076 -2.852692

    Clustering vector:
     [1] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
    [39] 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2

    Within cluster sum of squares by cluster:
    [1] 49.05775 49.05775
     (between_SS / total_SS =  91.4 %)

    Available components:

    [1] "cluster"      "centers"      "totss"        "withinss"     "tot.withinss"
    [6] "betweenss"    "size"         "iter"         "ifault"

    [39] 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2

              x         y
    1 -2.852692  3.057076
    2  3.057076 -2.852692

> Q. Plot x colored by the kmeans cluster assignment and add cluster

``` r
plot(x, col=km$cluster)
points(km$centers,col="blue", pch=15)
```

![](class07_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)

Play with kmeans and ask for different number of clusters.

``` r
km <- kmeans(x,centers=4,nstart=20)
plot(x, col=km$cluster)
points(km$centers,col="blue", pch=16)
```

# Hierarchical Clustering

This is another very useful and widely employed clustering method which
has the advantage over k-means in that is can help reveal something
about the true grouping in your data set.

The `hclust()` function wants a distance matrix as input. We can get
this from the `dist()` function.

``` r
d <- dist(x)
hc <- hclust(d)
hc
```


    Call:
    hclust(d = d)

    Cluster method   : complete 
    Distance         : euclidean 
    Number of objects: 60 

There is a plot method for `hclust()` results:

``` r
plot(hc)
abline(h=10,col="red")
```

![](class07_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)

To get my cluster membership vector I need to “cut” my tree to yield
sub-trees or branches with all the members of a given cluster. The
function to do this is called `cutree()`.

``` r
grps <- cutree(hc,h=10)
grps
```

     [1] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
    [39] 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2

``` r
plot(x,col=grps)
```

![](class07_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png)

``` r
plot(hc)
```

![](class07_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png)

It is often helpful to use the `k=` argument to `cutree()` rather than
the `h=` height of cutting with `cutree()`. This will cut the tree to
yield the number of clusters you want.

``` r
cutree(hc,k=4)
```

     [1] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3
    [39] 3 3 3 3 4 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3

# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

The base R function for PCA is called `prcomp()`. Let’s play with some
17D data (a very small dataset) and see how PCA can help.

# PCA of UK Food Data

Import the data

``` r
url <- "https://tinyurl.com/UK-foods"
x <- read.csv(url, row.names=1)
head(x)
```

                   England Wales Scotland N.Ireland
    Cheese             105   103      103        66
    Carcass_meat       245   227      242       267
    Other_meat         685   803      750       586
    Fish               147   160      122        93
    Fats_and_oils      193   235      184       209
    Sugars             156   175      147       139

> Q1. How many rows and columns are in your new data frame named x? What
> R functions could you use to answer this questions?

``` r
dim(x)
```

    [1] 17  4

I used the `dim()` function to find the number of columns and rows.

``` r
# Note how the minus indexing works
#rownames(x) <- x[,1]
#x <- x[,-1]
#head(x)
```

There are 17 rows and 4 columns once I adjusted it so that row-names was
not the first column.

> Q2. Which approach to solving the ‘row-names problem’ mentioned above
> do you prefer and why? Is one approach more robust than another under
> certain circumstances?

The second approach (fixing the problem when importing the data) is
probably ideal since running the `x <- x[-1]` multiple times will remove
a column each time. I have commented out these lines for subsequent runs
of code.

``` r
barplot(as.matrix(x), beside=F, col=rainbow(nrow(x)))
```

![](class07_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png)

> Q3: Changing what optional argument in the above barplot() function
> results in the following plot?

Changing the “beside” argument to be “FALSE” or “F” changes the
`barplot()`. Leaving this argument out would have the same effect since
the default value for this argument is “FALSE”.

``` r
pairs(x, col=rainbow(10), pch=16)
```

> Q5: Generating all pairwise plots may help somewhat. Can you make
> sense of the following code and resulting figure? What does it mean if

In this case, the pair-wise plots show comparisons between all countries
vs. all other countries in different food categories (i.e there is a
plot where each country is on the x-axis and another plot where it is on
the y-axis vs. all other countries). If a point lies on the diagonal of
a given plot, the two countries have the same value for that food
category.

> Q6. What is the main differences between N. Ireland and the other
> countries of the UK in terms of this data-set?

N. Ireland’s data is least similar to other countries in the dataset
(i.e values for respective food categories are not very often the same
between N. Ireland vs. England, Wales, or Scotland).

``` r
# Use the prcomp() PCA function 
pca <- prcomp( t(x) )
summary(pca)
```

    Importance of components:
                                PC1      PC2      PC3       PC4
    Standard deviation     324.1502 212.7478 73.87622 5.552e-14
